- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jakub-maker
    - I carry the title of Software Developer, but consider myself a bit of a engineer too as I have a pretty large design responsibility in my day to day.
    - I've got a bachelor in IT with Distinction, which I took forever to complete. I've been working in the industry full time for about 6 years now, I got in about 1-1.5 years into my degree. Yeeet.
    - A bit about me personally...
        - Married.
        - I work out regularly
        - I mess around with some music composition/record here and there
        - I am into video games. A bit into board games but i need to be invited to play them, I won't actively set up to play.
        - On a bit of a history books trip at the moment.
        - I've got cats. 
        - Interested in cars, very interseted in EVs.
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
    - I am more interested in backend work. I don't mind front-end though.
    - I work with Java 8 and Hibernate 3.5 (iirc). Which is a pretty legacy on premise desktop app. Lot's work with MS SQL Server, but can't use some of the new fancy stuff as I have been reminded a few times that some clients still use Server 2008...
    - I have some web dev experience, the standard CSS, JS (frameworks), PHP. I have a working understand of NodeJS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
    - I am messing around with Flutter and Dart for Mobile development with very basic SQLite. I am considering adding something like firebase just for the sake of seeing what it's like.
    - I am also messing around with a Spring Boot (open jdk 11) Gradle project to learn how to set up certain dependencies like Quartz, Hibernate etc... so it's mainly how to set things up and get them working type of deal with this one.
        - I wanted to jump into jdk 17, but Gradle doesn't support it (at the time). And I learnt that after I spend time tossing up between Gradle or Maven... so I just went with it instead of backtracking
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I don't know.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I assume Github has a message system...
